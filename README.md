# ShoeClassification
Machine Learning DataSet Classification - Models based off Alexnet, VggNet and ResNet

-Utilized Kaggleâ€™s image dataset to train a machine learning model to classify different types of shoes - achieving 98.33% accuracy.

-Utilized Pytorch to model various deep neural networks based on AlexNet, VGGNet and Resnet.

-Implemented preprocessing, training and evaluation pipelines as well as data augmentation methods that improved the model by 13%.
